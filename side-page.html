                        <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
                        <p>Washington State is situated in a highly active geologic area which contains shifting tectonic plates, crustal faults, and a subduction zone that all produce frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes occur here almost on a daily basis, and many of them go unnoticed.&nbsp;There are three types of earthquakes which may occur in our region: megathrust, intraplate (deep), and crustal (shallow).</p>
                        <p>Crustal faults are caused by the deformation within the North American Plate due to compression by neighboring tectonic plates. Crustal earthquakes occur no deeper than 18 miles below the surface, and can produce earthquakes as large as M7.5. Several major population hubs are situated directly atop such faults, such as the Seattle Fault which runs directly beneath the Cities of Seattle and Bellevue. The most recent Seattle Fault earthquake occurred about 1,100 years ago, and has been active 3-4 times over the past 3,000 years.</p>
                        <p>The most frequent types of earthquakes in Washington are Interplate (deep). These earthquakes rupture faults within the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate, and are usually less than M7.5. Because these earthquakes are so deep (18-42 miles beneath the surface), the seismic wave energy spreads over a much larger area than a shallow quake, thus shaking is felt over a larger geographic extent. Historically, interplate earthquakes occur every 10 to 30 years. The USGS estimates that there is an 84% chance of an interplate earthquake of M6.5 or great occurring within the next 50 years. Deep earthquakes larger than M6.0 occurred in 1909, 1939, 1946, 1949, 1965, and most recently on February 28, 2001 with the epicenter under the Nisqually Delta.</p>
                        <p>Megathrust earthquakes occur at subduction zones, and produce earthquakes as powerful as M9.0. In the Pacific Northwest, megathrust earthquakes occur along the Cascadian Subduction Zone. Historically, these earthquakes reoccur at a 500-year interval.</p>

                        <h2>Drought</h2>
                        <p>Droughts transpire when winters are warm and dry and there is little mountain snowpack, or when summers are especially dry and hot leading to a lack of moisture. Droughts should become more common with our climate shifting to warmer winters and drier summers.<br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Droughts can result in a variety of consequences in our environment, communities and everyday lives. Some of the specific impacts that can result from a drought include loss of wildlife habitat, poor soil quality, health problems, wildfires, and even loss of life.<br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>If a drought warning is issued always observe state and local restrictions on water use. For example, do not wash your car, water your lawn or pursue other non-essential water uses. Taking short showers instead of baths, storing drinking water in the refrigerator, avoiding using running water to thaw meats, and using a commercial car wash that recycles water are some ways to ease water use during a drought.</p>

                        <h2>Fires</h2>
                        <p>Fires can impact communities in a variety of forms and are among the deadliest hazards nation-wide. Specifically to Bellevue, fires can cause damage through large single structural fires, multi-structure fires, industrial fires, and vehicle fires. According to FEMA statistics, about 50% of residential fires are started by cooking, 12% by heating issues, and 6% by electrical malfunctions. Fires can be started in many other different ways including smoking, appliances, open flames, and arson.<br>

                            Fire safety begins with smoke alarms and established fire escape plans. Make sure that there are smoke alarms on every level of your home and inside bedrooms. Test your smoke alarms every month to ensure that they are working and have enough battery power. Plan a fire escape plan and practice with your family, roommates or co-workers twice a year. If a fire occurs in your home, get out of the building and stay out. Do not go back inside for any reason.<br>
                            <br>
                            While fires are still a significant danger, their impact has declined in certain areas in recent years. The amount of fires, deaths and injuries related to fires, and damage in terms of money have all noticeably dropped in numbers since 2005. These positive changes can mostly be attributed to better education on fire safety, a decrease in smoking and an increase in smoke alarms. Despite these improvements, fires are still one of the most dangerous hazards today and practicing personal fire safety remains vitally important.</p>
