                <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
                <p>Washington State is situated in a highly active geologic area which contains shifting tectonic
                    plates, crustal faults, and a subduction zone that all produce frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes
                    occur here almost on a daily basis, and many of them go unnoticed.&nbsp;There are three types of
                    earthquakes which may occur in our region: megathrust, intraplate (deep), and crustal (shallow).</p>
                <p>Crustal faults are caused by the deformation within the North American Plate due to compression by
                    neighboring tectonic plates. Crustal earthquakes occur no deeper than 18 miles below the surface,
                    and can produce earthquakes as large as M7.5. Several major population hubs are situated directly
                    atop such faults, such as the Seattle Fault which runs directly beneath the Cities of Seattle and
                    Bellevue. The most recent Seattle Fault earthquake occurred about 1,100 years ago, and has been
                    active 3-4 times over the past 3,000 years.</p>
                <p>The most frequent types of earthquakes in Washington are Interplate (deep). These earthquakes rupture
                    faults within the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate, and are usually less than M7.5. Because these
                    earthquakes are so deep (18-42 miles beneath the surface), the seismic wave energy spreads over a
                    much larger area than a shallow quake, thus shaking is felt over a larger geographic extent.
                    Historically, interplate earthquakes occur every 10 to 30 years. The USGS estimates that there is an
                    84% chance of an interplate earthquake of M6.5 or great occurring within the next 50 years. Deep
                    earthquakes larger than M6.0 occurred in 1909, 1939, 1946, 1949, 1965, and most recently on February
                    28, 2001 with the epicenter under the Nisqually Delta.</p>
                <p>Megathrust earthquakes occur at subduction zones, and produce earthquakes as powerful as M9.0. In the
                    Pacific Northwest, megathrust earthquakes occur along the Cascadian Subduction Zone. Historically,
                    these earthquakes reoccur at a 500-year interval.</p>

                            <h5>Before</h5>
                            <p class="sizeable">If your home was built before the use of mandatory seismic construction
                                standards, contact a contractor to find out how you can add seismic retrofits to your
                                home.<br>
                                Strap or bolt heavy furniture or cabinetry to the walls. Check the stability of hanging
                                objects such as ceiling fans and chandeliers.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h5>During</h5>
                            To reduce the likelihood of injury during during an earthquake remember to: DROP, COVER, and
                            HOLD. When the earth begins to shake remember to follow these instructions:&nbsp;<br>
                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>
                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                            Once the shaking has stopped, take the fastest and safest route out of the building. Do not use
                            elevators or enter damaged buildings. Aftershocks may occur.&nbsp;<br>
                            Check yourself for injuries.<br>
                            If you must evacuate your residence, leave a message stating where you are going and bring your
                            emergency kit.

                            <section>In an earthquake in the United States, more people are injured by the way they decorate
                                than by building collapse. Unsecured pictures, mirrors and bookcases pose a real threat. If
                                something in your home would readily fall and/or break and hurt someone in an earthquake,
                                you should bolt, anchor or strap it down.&nbsp;<br>

                <h2>Drought</h2>
                <p>Droughts transpire when winters are warm and dry and there is little mountain snowpack, or when
                    summers are especially dry and hot leading to a lack of moisture. Droughts should become more common
                    with our climate shifting to warmer winters and drier summers.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>Droughts can result in a variety of consequences in our environment, communities and everyday lives.
                    Some of the specific impacts that can result from a drought include loss of wildlife habitat, poor
                    soil quality, health problems, wildfires, and even loss of life.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>If a drought warning is issued always observe state and local restrictions on water use. For example,
                    do not wash your car, water your lawn or pursue other non-essential water uses. Taking short showers
                    instead of baths, storing drinking water in the refrigerator, avoiding using running water to thaw
                    meats, and using a commercial car wash that recycles water are some ways to ease water use during a
                    drought.</p>

                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>

                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                <h2>Fires</h2>
                <p>Fires can impact communities in a variety of forms and are among the deadliest hazards nation-wide.
                    Specifically to Bellevue, fires can cause damage through large single structural fires,
                    multi-structure fires, industrial fires, and vehicle fires. According to FEMA statistics, about 50%
                    of residential fires are started by cooking, 12% by heating issues, and 6% by electrical
                    malfunctions. Fires can be started in many other different ways including smoking, appliances, open
                    flames, and arson.<br>

                    <br>
                    Fire safety begins with smoke alarms and established fire escape plans. Make sure that there are
                    smoke alarms on every level of your home and inside bedrooms. Test your smoke alarms every month to
                    ensure that they are working and have enough battery power. Plan a fire escape plan and practice
                    with your family, roommates or co-workers twice a year. If a fire occurs in your home, get out of
                    the building and stay out. Do not go back inside for any reason.<br>
                    <br>
                    While fires are still a significant danger, their impact has declined in certain areas in recent
                    years. The amount of fires, deaths and injuries related to fires, and damage in terms of money have
                    all noticeably dropped in numbers since 2005. These positive changes can mostly be attributed to
                    better education on fire safety, a decrease in smoking and an increase in smoke alarms. Despite
                    these improvements, fires are still one of the most dangerous hazards today and practicing personal
                    fire safety remains vitally important.</p>

                            <h5>Before</h5>
                            <p class="sizeable">If your home was built before the use of mandatory seismic construction
                                standards, contact a contractor to find out how you can add seismic retrofits to your
                                home.<br>
                                Strap or bolt heavy furniture or cabinetry to the walls. Check the stability of hanging
                                objects such as ceiling fans and chandeliers.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h5>During</h5>
                            To reduce the likelihood of injury during during an earthquake remember to: DROP, COVER, and
                            HOLD. When the earth begins to shake remember to follow these instructions:&nbsp;<br>
                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>
                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                            Once the shaking has stopped, take the fastest and safest route out of the building. Do not use
                            elevators or enter damaged buildings. Aftershocks may occur.&nbsp;<br>
                            Check yourself for injuries.<br>
                            If you must evacuate your residence, leave a message stating where you are going and bring your
                            emergency kit.

                            <section>In an earthquake in the United States, more people are injured by the way they decorate
                                than by building collapse. Unsecured pictures, mirrors and bookcases pose a real threat. If
                                something in your home would readily fall and/or break and hurt someone in an earthquake,
                                you should bolt, anchor or strap it down.&nbsp;<br>

                    prevent flooding. When intense storms hit and overwhelm the system, flooding can occur.</p>

                            <section>In an earthquake in the United States, more people are injured by the way they decorate
                                than by building collapse. Unsecured pictures, mirrors and bookcases pose a real threat. If

                <h2>Infrastructure Failure</h2>
                <p class="sizeable"> Infrastructure includes the utilities and services that provide for basic needs
                    like transportation, energy, water, sewage, and communications. Failure of these services would lead
                    to significant consequences to the economy and health of the community. Washington has had some past
                    experiences with infrastructure failure including the I-5 Skagit River Bridge collapse in 2013 and
                    the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse in 1940. Both of these events caused massive transportation
                    issues and serve as reminders of the consequences following infrastructure failure.<br>
                    <br>
                    Most of the infrastructure built in the United States occurred in the 1950’s and many of these
                    structures and utilities are starting to show their age. The American Society of Civil Engineers
                    gave the United States infrastructure a D grade and estimates it would take $2.2 billion dollars to
                    fix it. Washington infrastructure concerns mostly include roads, bridges and mass transit.<br>
                    <br>
                    Washington is at particular risk for a 9.0 earthquake and there has been much attention recently
                    about how most buildings, roads and bridges in the state are significantly unequipped to be able
                    withstand a large earthquake. A lot of infrastructure was built before there was awareness of
                    Washington earthquake susceptibility, but the consequences still exist if infrastructure isn’t
                    updated and improved.</p>

                            event of an emergency situation. Emergency kits should be assembled prior to an emergency. Gas,
                            electricity, sewage and water may not function after a disaster occurs. Having an emergency kit
                            prepared beforehand may assuage stresses contingent upon these factors. Additionally, being
                            prepared will alleviate pressure on emergency responders.</p>

                            lightweight, insulating, and act as a vapor barrier. A tent or tarp can be utilized as
                            shelter.<br>

                                Strap or bolt heavy furniture or cabinetry to the walls. Check the stability of hanging

                            HOLD. When the earth begins to shake remember to follow these instructions:&nbsp;<br>
                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>
                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                            elevators or enter damaged buildings. Aftershocks may occur.&nbsp;<br>
                            Check yourself for injuries.<br>

                <h2>Landslides</h2>
                <p class="sizeable">Landslides occur when masses of earth, rock or debris move down<img
                        src="https://p1cdn4static.civiclive.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_4779004/Image/Fire/Emergency%20Management/Gerry%20Bozarth%2011.jpg"
                        alt="Oso Landslide" title="Oso Landslide"
                        style="left: 155px; top: 252px; width: 342px; height: 209px; float: right; margin-left: 3px;"> a
                    slope. Landslides can happen without warning and can range in size with some of the biggest ones
                    sliding at avalanche speeds. Earthquakes, significant rainfall, and human modifications of land are
                    some of the most common causes of landslides. Landslides can travel many miles from their source and
                    grow in size as they accumulate trees, cars, rocks and other debris.
                    Bellevue is in a relatively hilly region and experiences significant amounts of rainfall which makes
                    it susceptible to landslides. Rainfall can turn the earth on slopes into a flowing mud-like
                    consistency which can move rapidly down a slope. <br>
                    <br>
                    The recent Oso Landslide near Bellevue is a prime example of the damage that a large landslide can
                    do. The Oso Landslide was responsible for 43 deaths, 49 structures destroyed and covered
                    approximately a 1 square mile area.
                    Landslides can happen extremely quickly and without warning but there are some ways that an
                    individual can attempt to recognize signs of landslide forming. Bulging ground at the bottom of a
                    slope, widening cracks develop on the ground or on paved areas, and patterns of rainwater drainage
                    on hills or small slides can all indicate if a landslide is forming. Landslides can also be avoided
                    be being aware proper land-use procedures. <br>
                    <br>
                    Avoiding building on steep slopes, hill edges, drainage routes, and erosion areas can greatly
                    contribute to decreasing the likelihood of landslides occurring.</p>

                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>
                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                            <section>In an earthquake in the United States, more people are injured by the way they decorate
                                than by building collapse. Unsecured pictures, mirrors and bookcases pose a real threat. If
                                something in your home would readily fall and/or break and hurt someone in an earthquake,
                                you should bolt, anchor or strap it down.&nbsp;<br>

                <h2>Pandemic</h2>
                <p class="sizeable">A pandemic is a disease that infects large amounts of human populations spreading
                    across a vast region, even multiple continents and worldwide. The most severe pandemics are new
                    diseases that are highly infectious and lethal. New diseases can dramatically inhibit a community’s
                    ability to provide healthcare, hospital availability, and other critical services. The 20th century
                    has seen great strides made in medicine, but new deadly disease outbreak still remains a threat.<br>
                    <br>
                    Past pandemic examples include tuberculosis, influenza, hepatitis, smallpox, malaria, E. coli,
                    typhus, and cholera. The most recent pandemics include HIV and the H1N1 in 2009. New diseases can
                    become a pandemic if there is little immunity built up in communities, which can often be the
                    case.<br>
                    <br>
                    If a pandemic is highly infectious and deadly then healthcare services will be extremely limited and
                    individuals may have to take personal steps to protect themselves from infection. Personal practices
                    like avoiding close contact with other individuals, staying home when a disease breaks out,
                    frequently washing your hands, covering your mouth and nose, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose
                    or mouth can greatly contribute to avoiding infection from a pandemic.</p>

                            event of an emergency situation. Emergency kits should be assembled prior to an emergency. Gas,
                            electricity, sewage and water may not function after a disaster occurs. Having an emergency kit
                            prepared beforehand may assuage stresses contingent upon these factors. Additionally, being
                            prepared will alleviate pressure on emergency responders.</p>

                            lightweight, insulating, and act as a vapor barrier. A tent or tarp can be utilized as
                            shelter.<br>

                                Strap or bolt heavy furniture or cabinetry to the walls. Check the stability of hanging

                            HOLD. When the earth begins to shake remember to follow these instructions:&nbsp;<br>
                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>
                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                            Check yourself for injuries.<br>

                    <p class="sizeable">The Transportation Department begins preparing early for the snow season by
                        getting snow equipment ready, stockpiling supplies, and training staff for emergency response.
                        The city's&nbsp;<a title="link to snow routes priorities map"

                        city streets will be plowed first. The city's Transportation, Police and Fire departments work
                        together to create the map. The focus is on community health and safety and&nbsp;on doing the
                        most good for the most people.</p>
                    <p class="sizeable">During a snow storm,&nbsp;major streets and neighborhood priority routes are
                        cleared first to accommodate fire, medical and police response, as well as transit, school buses
                        and commuter traffic. If snowfall is continuous, those arterials may require repeated plowing
                        and sanding before crews can clear neighborhood streets.</p>

                        <li><strong>Extra time</strong>: Give yourself extra time. It's not worth putting yourself and

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Before leaving home</strong>: Pack winter safety equipment and a breakdown kit in
                            your vehicle. Prepare your vehicle by packing a shovel, flashlight, blankets and chains or
                            cables for the tires along with a breakdown kit.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Driving tips</strong>: The faster you're going, the longer it will take to stop.
                            When braking, do so slowly and never slam the brakes. If you have anti-lock brakes, press on
                            the pedal down firmly and hold it. If you don't have anti-lock brakes, gently pump the
                            pedal.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Black ice</strong>: Roads that seem dry or just wet may actually be slippery with
                            black ice. Take it slow when approaching intersections, off-ramps, bridges or shady areas,
                            common places for&nbsp;black ice.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Snowplows</strong>: Give snowplows room to work. The plows are wide and can cross
                            the centerline or shoulder. Do not tailgate and try not to pass. If you must pass, use
                            extreme caution and beware of the snow cloud.
                        </li>

                    <p class="sizeable">Severe cold can freeze the water in your pipes, causing them to burst. Be
                        cautious with alternative ways of heating your home. If freezing temperatures are in the
                        forecast, take the following steps:</p>
                    <ul class="sizeable">
                        <li>Drip warm water from the indoor faucet farthest from where water enters the house.</li>
                        <li>Insulate outdoor faucets and pipes in unheated garages and crawl spaces with newspaper, rags
                            or other insulating material. Cover with plastic and secure with string or wire. It's okay
                            to insulate the outside of your meter box, but please don’t put materials such as Styrofoam
                            peanuts inside, as this makes it difficult for city workers to access.
                        </li>
                        <li>If a water pipe breaks, immediately turn off the main water shut-off valve and/or water
                            meter to control flooding and water damage. Call a plumber. The main water shut-off valve is
                            usually located in the basement, garage or outside near&nbsp;the foundation. If there is no
                            main shut-off valve, there is a valve in the meter box that&nbsp;can be used in an
                            emergency. Turn clockwise with an adjustable wrench.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you use a kerosene heater, make sure there is plenty of ventilation. Keep heaters away
                            from curtains and clothing, and make sure heaters are turned off before going to bed. Never
                            use a gas or charcoal barbeque indoors. Do not leave children or pets alone with a portable
                            heater.

                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be

                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                <h2>Volcanic Activity</h2>
                <p class="sizeable">A volcano is a vent in the earth’s crust through which lava, rock fragments, gases,
                    and/or ash can be ejected from the earth’s molten core. Washington State is home to five major
                    active volcanoes: Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, and Glacier Peak.
                    Although Bellevue is not situated directly under or within the path of a volcano the City may
                    experience hazards such as ashfall and acid rain. City operations may or may not be curtailed by a
                    volcanic eruption because services and infrastructure are interdependent within the region and other
                    towns, cities, and counties may be requiring high levels of assistance. <br>
                    <br>
                    The impacts to Bellevue depends on the magnitude of the eruption and wind patterns. If the eruption
                    produced significant amounts of ash coupled with prime climatic conditions which could transport the
                    ash to Bellevue, the City’s normal operations could be stymied. Due to the prevailing wind patterns
                    within the region, the ash would probably blow away from Bellevue.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ash can collapse roofs, destroy engines, endanger utility networks, create hazardous road
                    conditions, and clog water, air, and filtration systems. Ashfall of more than 1 centimeter has the
                    ability to disrupt traffic by closing roads.<br>
                    <br>
                    Casualties are likely to be minimal compared to the economic impacts. The most deadly hazards such
                    as lahars, flashfloods, landslides and rockflows will not impact Bellevue. Hazards such as ashfall
                    and acid rain may impact Bellevue upon specific climatic conditions. Because geologists can
                    generally detect conditions that precede eruptions, the region may have time to prepare.<span

                            <h5>Before</h5>
                            <p class="sizeable">If your home was built before the use of mandatory seismic construction
                                standards, contact a contractor to find out how you can add seismic retrofits to your
                                home.<br>
                                Strap or bolt heavy furniture or cabinetry to the walls. Check the stability of hanging
                                objects such as ceiling fans and chandeliers.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h5>During</h5>
                            To reduce the likelihood of injury during during an earthquake remember to: DROP, COVER, and
                            HOLD. When the earth begins to shake remember to follow these instructions:&nbsp;<br>
                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>
                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                            Once the shaking has stopped, take the fastest and safest route out of the building. Do not use
                            elevators or enter damaged buildings. Aftershocks may occur.&nbsp;<br>
                            Check yourself for injuries.<br>
                            If you must evacuate your residence, leave a message stating where you are going and bring your
                            emergency kit.

                            <section>In an earthquake in the United States, more people are injured by the way they decorate
                                than by building collapse. Unsecured pictures, mirrors and bookcases pose a real threat. If
                                something in your home would readily fall and/or break and hurt someone in an earthquake,
                                you should bolt, anchor or strap it down.&nbsp;<br>

                            <li>Do not use gasoline-powered machinery, such as generators, indoors or in a garage; toxic
                                fumes can build up and are dangerous! Operate generators outdoors. Plug appliances
                                directly into the generator using heavy duty, properly grounded extension cords that
                                aren’t worn or frayed.
                            </li>
                            <li>Do not use charcoal grills indoors. Dangerous carbon monoxide can result.</li>
                            <li>Do not use a gas range or oven for room heating. A fuel-burning heater, such as a
                                kerosene heater, requires plenty of ventilation to prevent buildup of harmful fumes.
                                Place heaters on a hard surface away from flammable materials. Never leave children or
                                pets alone when using a portable heater.
                            </li>
                            <li>Turn off lights and appliances, including your furnace, and unplug sensitive electronic
                                devices, like computers to avoid a circuit overload when power is restored. Leave one
                                light switch on so you’ll know when service returns.
                            </li>
                            <li>Keep freezer and refrigerator doors closed; open them only when necessary.</li>
                            <li>Food will usually stay frozen for 36-48 hours in a fully loaded freezer if you keep the

                            <h5>Before</h5>
                            <p class="sizeable">If your home was built before the use of mandatory seismic construction
                                standards, contact a contractor to find out how you can add seismic retrofits to your
                                home.<br>
                                Strap or bolt heavy furniture or cabinetry to the walls. Check the stability of hanging
                                objects such as ceiling fans and chandeliers.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h5>During</h5>
                            To reduce the likelihood of injury during during an earthquake remember to: DROP, COVER, and
                            HOLD. When the earth begins to shake remember to follow these instructions:&nbsp;<br>
                            DROP where you are, onto your hands and knees. This position ensures that you will not be
                            knocked down and allows you to stay low and crawl to nearby shelter.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>
                            COVER your head and neck with one arm. If a table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it. If no
                            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall away from windows. Stay on your knees, bend
                            over to protect your vital organs.<br>
                            <br>
                            HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops, and be ready to move with your shelter if it
                            shifts. If you do not have shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands for
                            protection.&nbsp;<br>

                            Once the shaking has stopped, take the fastest and safest route out of the building. Do not use
                            elevators or enter damaged buildings. Aftershocks may occur.&nbsp;<br>
                            Check yourself for injuries.<br>
                            If you must evacuate your residence, leave a message stating where you are going and bring your
                            emergency kit.

                            <section>In an earthquake in the United States, more people are injured by the way they decorate
                                than by building collapse. Unsecured pictures, mirrors and bookcases pose a real threat. If
                                something in your home would readily fall and/or break and hurt someone in an earthquake,
                                you should bolt, anchor or strap it down.&nbsp;<br>
