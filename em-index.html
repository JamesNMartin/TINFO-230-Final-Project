                        <p>The Office of Emergency Management manages a comprehensive emergency management program and supports response efforts within the City of Bellevue. This process involves mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. We aim to prevent hazards from impacting residents altogether, and minimizing the effects of disasters when they occur.</p>

                        <p>Large-scale emergencies or events do not occur every day. During normal operations our office attends to essential tasks such as educating the public, creating plans, developing training and exercises, and engaging local and regional partners. City resilience depends on these day to day operations. </p>

                        <p>Response to emergencies or events that may harm residents requires coordination between city departments. The Office of Emergency Management manages that coordination from the Emergency Operations Center. Bellevue's EOC is a central location from which subject matter experts provide resources and expertise in support of incident response and recovery operations. </p>
