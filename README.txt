/************** README *****************/

the css directory contains the css files.... 

img_srcs contain the pictures for the headers of the pages

You guys can tweak the code around the section if you want. There's a problem with the sidebar on the right where it doesn't stay where it's at once the window reaches a certain width. I'm working on that but if you guys come up with a solution let me know.

To start inserting your content in the side-page.html file, start at line 44.

em-index.html is where the main page is going to be. I'll be tweaking the fonts once we get to that point of inserting javascript and the like.
